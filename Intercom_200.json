  "review_content": "What do you like best about Intercom?\nThe product itself is intuitive and robust and the investment the company has put into its AI offering has really paid off. We've seen a massive improvement in the AI chatbot's answers which are now deflecting around 50% of our conversations and allowing our team to work on more complex issues. The tool integrates with a ton of other products and serves most of the needs we have at the moment. The Customer Support team, as well as our Relationship Manager, are excellent and always super helpful.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Intercom?\nIt's not great for small companies that have multiple products. We are a small support team that wants to be able to support two different customer bases using two different products on different domains in the same workspace, but we currently have to manage two workspaces for the same team. It's also pricey compared to other help desk software, especially since each add on tends be an additional cost. The pricing model is also not great for our business model as far as using the tool for multiple departments (Support, Marketing, and Sales)—if we used it for all three, we would blow out our budget in one of those departments since we have to choose either active users or people reached to be billed for. Because of that, we had to reduce the amount of outbound contacts we were making with Intercom and focus on using it solely as a Support tool.\n\nWhat problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIntercom's investment in improving automation—both to handle customer conversations and to make support processes less manual—is solving operational inefficiencies and making it so that we can help more customers as our company grows without having to hire more people to the Support team.",

Especially in the last few years, Intercom has proven over and over again that they are a leader in taking advantage of tech innovations and using it to launch new features. The turnaround time is fast which allows them to be ahead of their competition.\n\nWhat I like about the tool the most:\n1. Good UX that's easy to use by our reps\n2. Lots of important features that every CS team needs like workflows, views, AI copilot, reports, API for building more custom reports, managers having a clear overview of all queues and rep statuses\n3. AI Chatbot (Fin) which, after it's well set up, adds real value to the day to day work and saves a ton of time that reps can then invest in other more impactful areas.\n4. Lots of options to customize the messenger popup, AI bot handoff steps, etc..\n\nWhat do you dislike about Intercom?\nWhen pushing custom properties into Intercom (like company or contact data), things can get messy really fast. When editing workflows, chat campaigns, or rules, there's no indicator if the selected property is a company or contact property, or any other type of property. This makes it very time consuming to set up and maintain automations and workflows. It also makes it harder to handoff admin responsibilities to another rep at the company.\n\nWhenever I asked for practical insight into how to set up workflows or the AI bot, the only resources I got access to were case studies or blog posts which don't talk about any specific ways how to set up e.g. the handoff sequence of Finbot. I'd love to learn more about how other companies solve some of the challenges we have, or have Intercom walk me through the setup. I eventually figured everything out but it'd help to have more guidance during the first steps of adoption.\n\nWhat problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?\nOffering live assistance to our to help them adopt the product faster (it helps us fill the gaps in areas where PLG isn't working yet)",

  "review_content": "What do you like best about Intercom?\nHaving access to the appropriate tools is crucial for me as our company's Customer Success Manager, since it determines our effectiveness and influence. For our team, Intercom's FIN AI Copilot has changed everything. Our operations and communication quality have significantly improved as a result of our capacity to rapidly access knowledge, automate responses, and provide real-time customer support.\n\nMy team has saved time on repetitive chores by using the AI Copilot's intuitive interface to swiftly access accurate information. Because of this, we are able to concentrate on offering our clients higher-value services, which has increased our response times and customer satisfaction levels. It's been a huge help to be able to optimize procedures without sacrificing service quality.\n\nOne particularly noteworthy aspect is the clever suggestion engine. The program makes sure that everyone is on the same page and gives team members—especially the more recent hires—greater confidence in their interactions by recommending suitable answers based on previous encounters. Furthermore, because the AI can learn from repeated interactions, it continuously adjusts to meet our needs and gradually increases our efficiency.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Intercom?\nBecause Intercom has so many capabilities, new users or those not accustomed with the platform may find it daunting at times. Without significant training, navigating the depth of capability can be challenging.\n\nWhat problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?\nLive chat, automatic messaging, and FIN AI Copilot are just a few of the communication solutions offered by Intercom that enable speedier and more efficient replies. The Customer Success team saves time by providing precise replies without requiring additional investigation thanks to AI-driven insights. Better customer loyalty and retention result from this, which in turn leads to longer-term company growth and fewer churn problems.",

  "review_content": "What do you like best about Intercom?\nIntercom has a complete package of customer service tools, including documentation (knowledgebase), on-site messaging, ticketing, site tours, and other user adoption tools. The app itself is blazing fast, which is a pleasure to work with. The Wordpress plugin works like a charm: if you run a Wordpress site, user data is synched automatically with the plugin. I appreciate the fact that the tool is not metered by number of users, so if you have a large number of free users, you don't get charged unless you send them certain types of messages. Customer service is always friendly and usually can help me get to the answer. Their own AI customer service tool is generally good & saves a lot of time.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Intercom?\nThere is definitely a steeper learning curve than I was expecting, as a solopreneur. Some things are really much better if you can get developer hours (on-site tours and event tracking are examples). Some parts of the tool are not customizable -- you have to accept the existing formatting or setup (banners, site tours, posts). There is no built-in option for multilingual site tours.\n\nWhat problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?\nUser adoption was my primary challenge. I liked that Intercom can give site tours, on-site messaging, chatbots, and documentation all in one tool. They are stronger with chatbots, help desk, and tickets, and relatively less strong with site tours. However, the fact that they have it all is what sold me on Intercom.",

Intercom has become a tool we use every day for managing our communications with customers. Before, we had different tools that we ended up combining into one with Intercom.\n\nOn one hand, the chat feature allows us to control all the conversations that come in, and with the automatic bots, it facilitates the qualification of the different leads that enter. Lastly, the fact that we can have all the help center articles on the same platform makes it much easier to share an article directly from the support chat.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Intercom?\nThe onboarding takes some time until everything is set up, but it is true that the product is well-prepared in this regard to guide you.\n\nThe series/tours part is the only thing we haven't completely moved to Intercom; here we continue using another application as it offers us more flexibility.\n\nWhat problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIt is an essential tool for support and Customer Success.\n\nIt allows us to resolve user queries in real-time. Detect bugs and incidents. Capture leads and automatically qualify them to decide which funnel to include them in. Have all the help articles so that the user can self-service to resolve their doubts when starting with the platform. We save response macros to streamline support work and standardize responses. Marketing can launch banners if there is any special announcement or webinar they want to announce to users/leads, it also helps us communicate if there is any outage or specific problem.\n\nWe are a software that offers services to other companies, and without a doubt, Intercom makes it easier for us to provide a differential value with support to our clients.",

  "review_content": "What do you like best about Intercom?\nThe user interface is easy to use and it's very intuitive. It allows in-platform user communication via number of channels, such as surveys, messages or banners as well as email and chatbot.\n\nThe articles and knowledge base that feed into the chatbot are very effective too. It's great to have a centralized place for customer communications and product marketing.\n\nMy team and I use Intercom nearly every day. It has been easy to implement and integrate with other channels, such as Slack.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Intercom?\nBeing able to pick the exact elements of your subscription is a cost-efficient way to use the platform. But you can't effectively use some options without paying for others, so it feels like a constant upsell.\n\nI had a mixed experience with customer support. The highly effective chatbot means that a lot of issues can be resolved in no time. But anytime I need to speak to a human it takes a long time to be connected. I have encountered a range of customer support agents too - some of them incredibly helpful, and others less so.\n\nWhat problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe product tours have been an incredibly useful feature. It means that the tech team no longer has to spend time trying to build informative pop-ups in the platform. In turn, this means that marketing is fully in control of the content and everyone has far more flexibility.",

  "review_content": "What do you like best about Intercom?\nI think it's the most robust customer engagement and support tool out there. And at the same time, it's easy to use and has virtually no learning curve. I use it for pretty much everything: chat and email support, which is smooth both for our users (customer-facing experience) and our team. There's a wealth of options like enriching customer data with custom attributes, all data about our customers is at our fingertips and it's seamlessly integrated with our tech stack. I could go on about Intercom's support features forever. Let me just say:the do the trick. We run our Help Center on Intercom, too. Their Help Center feature has recently been revamped, making it best-in-class. It has modern UX, UI, and offers countless customization options. I also use Intercom for targeted customer engagement, like for sending out in-apps, displaying baners, and more. For our early-stage start up, it has everything we need - plus there's a ton of features they offer which we currently don't need, but it's reassuring they are there for when we scale up. Their support turnaround times have improved immensely recently, which is important for us, given that we're based in Europie. Honestly, I'm a bit of a fanboy. Each SaaS company I've worked in had Intercom set up right when I was onboarded. In my last role, I got the team to transition to Intercom. It's great and easy to implement.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Intercom?\nThe pay per email sent (for customer engagement emails) pricing could be less expensive. I'd like to see the dark mode across the whole app, rather than only help desk. On rare occassions, there are momentary lapses, but they are quickly sorted out.\n\nWhat problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe use Intercom for supporting our customers via chat and by email. Our Help Center runs on Intercom. We also send out customer engagement messagse via in-app and email, use banners, and other features. It's integrated with our product and tech stack, making support and engagement seamless and easy. We use it for a multitude of use cases and all things customer support and engagement. Despite the large number of features, they're perfectly synced with one another and using Intercom is smooth sailing. Intercom saves me a lot of time and headaches in staying on top of customer expectations, and I know that using it, I can expect top-tier, cutting-edge features that are in line with the newest SaaS trends and help our customer operations look modern.",

  "review_content": "What do you like best about Intercom?\nIntercom is a great way to provide customer service for a company. It is a seamless and easy way to interact with your users and help them with questions, issues, etc.. The Help Desk is easy to use and is a much better way of handling customer service than over the phone. Being able to manage inbound, outbound, help articles, notifications, and more in one platform is so great. The wait time to talk with a customer service rep from Intercom is a little long but each time they are always incredibly nice and extremely helpful! They are all very easy to talk to and always involve gifs and emojis, making it more fun to chat! Intercom provides a home page on the bubble within your product that you can customize which I really like. This allows me to update the home page to inform users of new builds, issues, updated help articles, and more.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Intercom?\nCertain aspects of Intercom is quite a learning curve unfortunately. Creating workflows, organizing users/companies, and trying to add certain automations can be difficult to learn and time consuming. You definitely have to give certain aspects of Intercom a fair bit of time to get the hang of it. Fortunately, it is only for additional items and not your everyday sections of Intercom. I have been working with Intercom for almost one year now and I'm still trying to find time to allow myself to be better familiar with workflows to improve my day-to-day tasks. The help articles can sometimes be a little difficult to follow which makes it hard to use them when wanting to learn certain areas in Intercom.\n\nWhat problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIntercom has solved removing the exhausting and out-dated telephone customer service. It is so much nicer to handle customer service through a digital messaging service instead of phone call after phone call. Phone customer service can be draining to ones mental health making their job more difficult and make one not enjoy their work as much. Intercom has created an amazing way to finally move on from phone customer service! Intercom is also solving the organization of your customer service. Having everything in one platform is amazing to be able to easily link help articles, tickets, etc. to conversations to keep track of what your users are dealing with.",

It also is easy to navigate between your inbox and other inboxes. There are several features available for use that have been super great for campaigns to customers. The best feature is the bot or fin. It's super trainable and we currently have a 70% resolved score.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Intercom?\nIt is difficult talking to support, each person comes back with a different answer and sometimes it takes days to get a response back or no response at all when trying to contact a human. Due to this getting new feature add-ons is a pain and the add-ons are very expensive. We also weren't aware we had as many features as we did within our initial subscription. The biggest pain point myself and my team has is with reporting. The reports are confusing and when we try to recreate custom reports for teams, they never align with pre-made reports. We always just hope the numbers are accurate. Tagging for reports is not ideal and it would be great if you could just separate reports by teams.\n\nWhat problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIntercom has helped us tremendously with easy questions and conversations. The chatbot we have trained saves us over 600 human working hours monthly, which is huge. It has also been great fro running campaigns to customers.",

The automations are pretty good although I do wish there was a bit more customization but I'm able to achieve most of my goals. My support team loves working out of Intercom and has made great views for themselves to ensure efficiency. I can't speak to Implementation or Integration since I adopted it and did not set it up when I joined my company. Their AI chatbot is also really awesome. We're planning to grow with that and I'm really optimistic that it'll only get better. Overall, I would definitely recommend Intercom the software. It's got everything I need. The reporting is also really helpful and extremely easy to build if you wanted to make custom reporting.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Intercom?\nBulk actions are basically not supported almost at all. If you want to mass remove a tag for users for example you have to do a really wild and time confusing workaround. I adopted Intercom and I wanted to clean up a bunch of things but was always met with workarounds and no easy solutions. The Support (support team) is pretty good although they lack one fundamental piece which is anticipating the customers needs. Something I train my own Support team to keep top of mind as customers usually tend to think about the current/short term goal and not the long term affects - saving headaches, confusion, and clean up. The CS team is also good but lack of follow up and consideration for customers time is lacking (I had a similar experience with their Engineering team, no follow up). I made a huge change which took me 2 weeks to fully complete and it was due to lack of support, even after reading through the help center and reaching out to Support, it caused a complete waste of time due to consequences I was not aware of (again, not something that I was prepared for even after reaching out to Support or reading the help center - I don't know what I don't know).\n\nWhat problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?\nResponding to Customer inquiries in a centralized place that allows us to prioritze based on SLA and Tier.",
