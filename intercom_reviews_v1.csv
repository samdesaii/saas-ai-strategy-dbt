The product itself is intuitive and robust and the investment the company has put into its AI offering has really paid off. We've seen a massive improvement in the AI chatbot's answers which are now deflecting around 50% of our conversations and allowing our team to work on more complex issues. The tool integrates with a ton of other products and serves most of the needs we have at the moment. The Customer Support team, as well as our Relationship Manager, are excellent and always super helpful.

What do you dislike about Intercom?
It's not great for small companies that have multiple products. We are a small support team that wants to be able to support two different customer bases using two different products on different domains in the same workspace, but we currently have to manage two workspaces for the same team. It's also pricey compared to other help desk software, especially since each add on tends be an additional cost. The pricing model is also not great for our business model as far as using the tool for multiple departments (Support, Marketing, and Sales)—if we used it for all three, we would blow out our budget in one of those departments since we have to choose either active users or people reached to be billed for. Because of that, we had to reduce the amount of outbound contacts we were making with Intercom and focus on using it solely as a Support tool.

What problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?
Intercom's investment in improving automation—both to handle customer conversations and to make support processes less manual—is solving operational inefficiencies and making it so that we can help more customers as our company grows without having to hire more people to the Support team.",True
10660491,2024-12-17T00:00:00,5.0,Mid-Market(51-1000 emp.),Customer support agent,"What do you like best about Intercom?
For me, the most beneficial feature is the easy way that I can create emails and chats to the different areas and people that I am constantly responsible for assisting. I work 5 days a week and have different interactions with customers every day, but this tool just makes it easier for me to provide good customer support, make it clear, and also for them to understand our way of communicating via emails or chats.

What do you dislike about Intercom?
Perhaps one of the things that could be a problem for me is just the double chats and emails that I'm getting all the time, but at this point, I know how to deal with them and integrate them into the new ones with the clients and how professional I have to be, apply the knowledge that I have and provide the best for those situations.

It is an easy way to communicate and resolve any questions or doubts that we constantly get from our customers. It helps me to let them know all the details about it, for anything they need, or also to send documentation most easily.",True
10656024,2024-12-17T00:00:00,4.5,Mid-Market(51-1000 emp.),Director of Support,"What do you like best about Intercom?
We are a business inteligence company and have been using Intercom for 7 years for B2B. And we love it! Especially in the last few years, Intercom has proven over and over again that they are a leader in taking advantage of tech innovations and using it to launch new features. The turnaround time is fast which allows them to be ahead of their competition.

What I like about the tool the most:
1. Good UX that's easy to use by our reps
2. Lots of important features that every CS team needs like workflows, views, AI copilot, reports, API for building more custom reports, managers having a clear overview of all queues and rep statuses
3. AI Chatbot (Fin) which, after it's well set up, adds real value to the day to day work and saves a ton of time that reps can then invest in other more impactful areas.
4. Lots of options to customize the messenger popup, AI bot handoff steps, etc..

What do you dislike about Intercom?
When pushing custom properties into Intercom (like company or contact data), things can get messy really fast. When editing workflows, chat campaigns, or rules, there's no indicator if the selected property is a company or contact property, or any other type of property. This makes it very time consuming to set up and maintain automations and workflows. It also makes it harder to handoff admin responsibilities to another rep at the company.

Whenever I asked for practical insight into how to set up workflows or the AI bot, the only resources I got access to were case studies or blog posts which don't talk about any specific ways how to set up e.g. the handoff sequence of Finbot. I'd love to learn more about how other companies solve some of the challenges we have, or have Intercom walk me through the setup. I eventually figured everything out but it'd help to have more guidance during the first steps of adoption.

The chat modality has been a game changer for our business, allowing us to provide near-instant support where previously we had been spread across multiple channels. We have been able to integrate several channels/apps that we use, which additionally helps with triaging feedback and customer concerns. The team orients to it quickly, and are able to move within it without too much confusion. We use it all day, every day, and it has been a game changer for our org.

What do you dislike about Intercom?
There are some data limitations that affect us; it would be great if they could make that side of things more robust.

What problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?
It used to take a solid amount of time to respond to issues that our users were having, because the team was spread so thin across so many platforms, and it was impossible to actually engage with each of those platforms completely.

Outbound tooling that allows for direct 'in-context' communication. The possibilities to give your customer the context/support they need at the point where they need it, allows for a smooth and effortless experience for your end-user. In combination with the omni-support channels, I think it is a very complete product.

What do you dislike about Intercom?
The combination of conversation and tickets is a bit strange, as they both seem to leverage the same underlying object. This causes some strange behavior at times in applying automations regarding SLAs or conversions. In the end this impacts in gaining proper insights in how we have performed.

What problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?
A quick and direct way to communicate with our userbase. The barrier of reaching out to our users and getting proper responses have dropped significantly.

The AI components within Intercom are awesome. The AI Agent has saved my teams tons of time on inquiries. We thouroughly enjoy watching Fin work its magic answering our common questions!!

I love that Fin gains its knowledge from all of ours assets - Custom Answers, highly rated conversations, Articles, and Snippets, and that Intercom has created a Knowledge Hub where we can organize all of these for easy updating and creation!

What do you dislike about Intercom?
They've been working on reporting and metrics, which is great. They could use a little more work so you can have more customization on what you want to view.

Intercom's own customer support has gotten better as well but it can still take a while to hear back or get help. Sometimes the support people seem to need to get additional support or questions answered before they get back to you.

Every important matter is highligthed, you receive a lot of updates,a nd notifications about it, and also everything can be toggled to be seen or hided.

I use the app evey day, and 1 to 2 times a week, I receive either updates, advices, and paths to learn how easy the tasks are when you use intercom.

Also, the support that the app gives you in the chat is very high, ver effective, and very fast.

What do you dislike about Intercom?
I dislike that sometimes, the app overloads with information and starts to run slowly, and you can either wait until crashes, or you can refresh it for a temporal solution. Sometimes, the app needs you to restart the pc in order to start working good again.

I don't like that some of the vital points of the app are not very well integrated, or related between them (Things like datapoints, and quick links) and sometimes, the relation between those is outdated, and creates an issue in the information.

Intercom allows us to manage both reactive and proactive support, set automations to provide customer support in context, and make the best of our resources.
Implementation and onboarding of the team was a breeze, and we continue to learn its features with Intercom Community and Academy.

What do you dislike about Intercom?
While Intercom gives a great solution to house our help center, formatting and editing are not very flexible, so we feel we're constricted in terms of fonts, images, and interactive elements.
Additionally, we've had some issues with integrations mainly with Salesforce and Client success.

What problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?
As our company grew, we started to see that reactive support was not enough. We needed to be able to lead our customers in-app, even when they didn't know they needed guidance.

Intercom has saved me an outrageous amount of time over the last two months. As a sole marketer (who also handles the whole communication flywheel), Intercom Series have been a gamechanger for me. I have built email and chat flows across our whole sales funnel, from trial signup and activation to customer onboarding and review campaigns.

Series are super easy to setup (from product events triggering automated outreach to email actions opening up automated email flows).

Intercom integrates with all of the tools in our tech stack and with our product really easily.

The only downside to using Intercom is that I don't have a team around me helping with activation and customer onboarding. I don't think I've saved more time with any other tool (besides ChatGPT).

One of the best features, ticketing, allows me to create customer cases and track their requests; you can also see how many agents are focused on a customer's request and establish internal communication. This application is essential for improving customer service through chat, email, social media, technical support, and other channels. The application's built-in chat and messaging capabilities enable instant interaction with customers. This greatly improves response times and overall customer service satisfaction. By effectively handling repetitive questions, automation solutions such as workflows and chatbots have also greatly reduced our team's workload. Intercom is a well-structured program that anyone can use with ease.

What I dislike about Intercom is that, unfortunately, once you exit the 95% discount of the startup program, the pricing becomes quite hefty.

Because of this, we are able to concentrate on offering our clients higher-value services, which has increased our response times and customer satisfaction levels. It's been a huge help to be able to optimize procedures without sacrificing service quality.

One particularly noteworthy aspect is the clever suggestion engine. The program makes sure that everyone is on the same page and gives team members—especially the more recent hires—greater confidence in their interactions by recommending suitable answers based on previous encounters. Furthermore, because the AI can learn from repeated interactions, it continuously adjusts to meet our needs and gradually increases our efficiency.

Lot of people will say the price. It is expensive, but when you compare that to the time you save over using something else, I think it's a bit of a no-brainer. They have simplified their pricing a lot more in the last year or so too, which makes it much better

The integration with HubSpot is not so good, but I think this was maybe on HubSpot's end. It made the migration across a bit of a pain, as our sales/success teams weren't able to see conversations in Intercom as easily as we'd have liked.

I love that Intercom has a widely integrated system to provide granularity and precision when we build customer communication strategies. I can be very specific, and there are many functionalities I can choose from. It's my daily job to use Intercom and I really like how easy it is to get in touch with my customers, providing support not only via chat, bu being able to link knowledge base articles as well is really powerful!

AI is still a bit confuse to set, also not being able to delete some old stuff. This has been improving with time, though.

Intercom has a complete package of customer service tools, including documentation (knowledgebase), on-site messaging, ticketing, site tours, and other user adoption tools. The app itself is blazing fast, which is a pleasure to work with. The Wordpress plugin works like a charm: if you run a Wordpress site, user data is synched automatically with the plugin. I appreciate the fact that the tool is not metered by number of users, so if you have a large number of free users, you don't get charged unless you send them certain types of messages. Customer service is always friendly and usually can help me get to the answer. Their own AI customer service tool is generally good & saves a lot of time.

What do you dislike about Intercom?
There is definitely a steeper learning curve than I was expecting, as a solopreneur. Some things are really much better if you can get developer hours (on-site tours and event tracking are examples). Some parts of the tool are not customizable -- you have to accept the existing formatting or setup (banners, site tours, posts). There is no built-in option for multilingual site tours.

What problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?
User adoption was my primary challenge. I liked that Intercom can give site tours, on-site messaging, chatbots, and documentation all in one tool. They are stronger with chatbots, help desk, and tickets, and relatively less strong with site tours. However, the fact that they have it all is what sold me on Intercom.",True

Unfortunately, the UI could be better. We frequently spend some time finding where is an specific setting or feature. Some tables could have more sorting options. Only a few columns could be sorted on certain screens.

The main reason that we hired Intercom was the Live Chat and Help Desk. It's really greater than the competitors that we tried.

I would prefer if the Conversations report gave the manager the chance to consult what were the chats we received on a specific time frame, and forward us to the link of the conversation, that would help us speed up our Quality reviews since nowadays, we only get to see the volume of chats, but not what those chats were.

There are 2 parts to my department, support and success. For support, intercom has been very helpful; however, for success it has been a nightmare. The sales representatives at intercom assured us that their platform can be used as a CRM and we fell for it. It is difficult to use, picks and chooses when to save data, and if a CSV is uploaded, intercom will delete other information randomly.

I think the one thing I like the most about Intercom is how simple and easily digestable the user interface was. I think that there were the right amount of buttons and everything was labeled very intuitively. When you first start using the platform it can be tricky to learn what each symbol stands for, but once you get the hang of it, the platform becomes a second nature almost.

It was suuuuper easy to integrate our work email and implimenting it into our user experience flow. A lot of users of our product enjoyed being able to use the chat  features and giving the experience to ""talk to us"" directly.

Literally I use it all of the time to help with customer support tickets and is our go to platform to make sure our users get the help they need as efficiently as possible.

We have been using Intercom in our company for over a year, and the experience has been extraordinary. Intercom has become a tool we use every day for managing our communications with customers. Before, we had different tools that we ended up combining into one with Intercom.

On one hand, the chat feature allows us to control all the conversations that come in, and with the automatic bots, it facilitates the qualification of the different leads that enter. Lastly, the fact that we can have all the help center articles on the same platform makes it much easier to share an article directly from the support chat.

The onboarding takes some time until everything is set up, but it is true that the product is well-prepared in this regard to guide you.

Marketing can launch banners if there is any special announcement or webinar they want to announce to users/leads, it also helps us communicate if there is any outage or specific problem.

I use intercom everyday to talk to customers who need help, who have a question or really anything related to communication. When I started using it, I thought it was pretty good, but I didn't know the many other features it had to help me better structure my day to day with customers.

What I like the most is that even if Intercom is a big platform for giving support, their support is also very fast and accurate !

I like they communicate new features and ideas through their own channel, I can see what my customers are going to see if I activate the proactive support, or FinAI.

What do you dislike about Intercom?
Intercom is a complex product, and even though I don’t consider that to be a negative thing about it, sometimes I simply don't have the time to read through the articles. For more complicated paths like establishing rules I had a hard time finding the right information by going from one article to another.  Otherwise, is very easy to use and to understand !

The user interface is easy to use and it's very intuitive. It allows in-platform user communication via number of channels, such as surveys, messages or banners as well as email and chatbot.

The articles and knowledge base that feed into the chatbot are very effective too. It's great to have a centralized place for customer communications and product marketing.

My team and I use Intercom nearly every day. It has been easy to implement and integrate with other channels, such as Slack.

What do you dislike about Intercom?
Being able to pick the exact elements of your subscription is a cost-efficient way to use the platform. But you can't effectively use some options without paying for others, so it feels like a constant upsell.

I had a mixed experience with customer support. The highly effective chatbot means that a lot of issues can be resolved in no time. But anytime I need to speak to a human it takes a long time to be connected. I have encountered a range of customer support agents too - some of them incredibly helpful, and others less so.

What problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?

What do you dislike about Intercom?
On the odd occasion, there have been a couple of limits on how I can run a product tour.

I think it's the most robust customer engagement and support tool out there. And at the same time, it's easy to use and has virtually no learning curve. I use it for pretty much everything: chat and email support, which is smooth both for our users (customer-facing experience) and our team. There's a wealth of options like enriching customer data with custom attributes, all data about our customers is at our fingertips and it's seamlessly integrated with our tech stack. I could go on about Intercom's support features forever. Let me just say:the do the trick. We run our Help Center on Intercom, too. Their Help Center feature has recently been revamped, making it best-in-class. It has modern UX, UI, and offers countless customization options. I also use Intercom for targeted customer engagement, like for sending out in-apps, displaying baners, and more. For our early-stage start up, it has everything we need - plus there's a ton of features they offer which we currently don't need, but it's reassuring they are there for when we scale up. Their support turnaround times have improved immensely recently, which is important for us, given that we're based in Europie. Honestly, I'm a bit of a fanboy. Each SaaS company I've worked in had Intercom set up right when I was onboarded. In my last role, I got the team to transition to Intercom. It's great and easy to implement.

What do you dislike about Intercom?
The pay per email sent (for customer engagement emails) pricing could be less expensive. I'd like to see the dark mode across the whole app, rather than only help desk. On rare occassions, there are momentary lapses, but they are quickly sorted out.

What problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?
We use Intercom for supporting our customers via chat and by email. Our Help Center runs on Intercom. We also send out customer engagement messagse via in-app and email, use banners, and other features. It's integrated with our product and tech stack, making support and engagement seamless and easy. We use it for a multitude of use cases and all things customer support and engagement. Despite the large number of features, they're perfectly synced with one another and using Intercom is smooth sailing. Intercom saves me a lot of time and headaches in staying on top of customer expectations, and I know that using it, I can expect top-tier, cutting-edge features that are in line with the newest SaaS trends and help our customer operations look modern.",True

Intercom is a great way to provide customer service for a company. It is a seamless and easy way to interact with your users and help them with questions, issues, etc.. The Help Desk is easy to use and is a much better way of handling customer service than over the phone. Being able to manage inbound, outbound, help articles, notifications, and more in one platform is so great. The wait time to talk with a customer service rep from Intercom is a little long but each time they are always incredibly nice and extremely helpful! They are all very easy to talk to and always involve gifs and emojis, making it more fun to chat! Intercom provides a home page on the bubble within your product that you can customize which I really like. This allows me to update the home page to inform users of new builds, issues, updated help articles, and more.

What do you dislike about Intercom?
Certain aspects of Intercom is quite a learning curve unfortunately. Creating workflows, organizing users/companies, and trying to add certain automations can be difficult to learn and time consuming. You definitely have to give certain aspects of Intercom a fair bit of time to get the hang of it. Fortunately, it is only for additional items and not your everyday sections of Intercom. I have been working with Intercom for almost one year now and I'm still trying to find time to allow myself to be better familiar with workflows to improve my day-to-day tasks. The help articles can sometimes be a little difficult to follow which makes it hard to use them when wanting to learn certain areas in Intercom.

What problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?
Intercom has solved removing the exhausting and out-dated telephone customer service. It is so much nicer to handle customer service through a digital messaging service instead of phone call after phone call. Phone customer service can be draining to ones mental health making their job more difficult and make one not enjoy their work as much. Intercom has created an amazing way to finally move on from phone customer service! Intercom is also solving the organization of your customer service.

There are several features available for use that have been super great for campaigns to customers. The best feature is the bot or fin. It's super trainable and we currently have a 70% resolved score.

What do you dislike about Intercom?
It is difficult talking to support, each person comes back with a different answer and sometimes it takes days to get a response back or no response at all when trying to contact a human. Due to this getting new feature add-ons is a pain and the add-ons are very expensive. We also weren't aware we had as many features as we did within our initial subscription. The biggest pain point myself and my team has is with reporting. The reports are confusing and when we try to recreate custom reports for teams, they never align with pre-made reports. We always just hope the numbers are accurate. Tagging for reports is not ideal and it would be great if you could just separate reports by teams.

The platform itself is pretty great. The automations are pretty good although I do wish there was a bit more customization but I'm able to achieve most of my goals. My support team loves working out of Intercom and has made great views for themselves to ensure efficiency. I can't speak to Implementation or Integration since I adopted it and did not set it up when I joined my company. Their AI chatbot is also really awesome. We're planning to grow with that and I'm really optimistic that it'll only get better. Overall, I would definitely recommend Intercom the software. It's got everything I need. The reporting is also really helpful and extremely easy to build if you wanted to make custom reporting.

What do you dislike about Intercom?
Bulk actions are basically not supported almost at all. If you want to mass remove a tag for users for example you have to do a really wild and time confusing workaround. I adopted Intercom and I wanted to clean up a bunch of things but was always met with workarounds and no easy solutions. The Support (support team) is pretty good although they lack one fundamental piece which is anticipating the customers needs. Something I train my own Support team to keep top of mind as customers usually tend to think about the current/short term goal and not the long term affects - saving headaches, confusion, and clean up. The CS team is also good but lack of follow up and consideration for customers time is lacking (I had a similar experience with their Engineering team, no follow up). I made a huge change which took me 2 weeks to fully complete and it was due to lack of support, even after reading through the help center and reaching out to Support, it caused a complete waste of time due to consequences I was not aware of (again, not something that I was prepared for even after reaching out to Support or reading the help center - I don't know what I don't know).

I don't like the experience of updating conversation data, I wish this could be done with keyboard shotcuts, instead I often end up accidentally triggering the wrong ones when trying to search for  conversatoin data because the input box hasn't got focus. Then I have to wait a couple of seconds before I can close the conversation or I have to enter it again. It's a minor, but frequent annoyance. If they fixed this, I'd give a 10 score.

What problems is Intercom solving and how is that benefiting you?
Intercom helps me to support my customers at scale. I use targeted custom bot flows to gather the right information from people with issues saving me a huge amount of time. I send articles frequently to answer customer questions and encourage people to self-serve in future. Intercom's article suggestions reliably resolve a few hundred conversations for me each week.",True

Intercom is simple to use.

Before starting my current job where intercom is our main form of communicating with customers, I had never heard or used intercom.

After completing my training (In under 2 weeks instead of 4!) I was confident in using Intercom alone.

The ability send macros and allowing Resbot to attempt to answer our customer supports most common questions is great as this allows us to spend more time with customers who need that extra help.

Personally I believe Intercom does not have any cons.

Myself and my team will be introducing 'Back office' tickets and looking to explore Fin within the next quarter.

Over the years, Intercom has become our primary tool to service our customers, mixing chat, email support, and now a brilliant AI. Their constant innovation feels like having a tech-savvy buddy in our corner, making customer service incredibly painless for our team. It's been an uncomplicated tool to train new users on, and just as easy to scale as our team has grown over the years. I also appreciate that their team is always a quick message away if we have questions about our plan or features.

What do you dislike about Intercom?
My primary dislike would be the costs. While the basic features cover most needs, some of the more advanced capabilities and integrations will come with additional costs. As you start adding more advanced features to your contract, it's easy to begin to feel like you're being nickel and dimed.
